class BitMgr:
    """ This is a serious worker class that provides lots of functionality.
    We will look at the static class variables and method first, then describe
    those of the instance.
    Static Class Variables:
    - cur: index value of the current bit array
    - nex: index value of the future bit array
    both the above work with the instance variable cnConfig which is a vector
    of length 2. each elt of the vector is itself a vector of ints used 
    as 8 bits.
    Next, we have the 3 RegEndPoints tuples:
    - switchRegEndPoints 
    - ivtrRegEndPoints 
    - allRegEndPoints 
    these are used to know where the switch connections are managed and where
    the ivtr bits are managed in view of clearing, updating etc. The usage
    is explained in the instance methods below.
    Next, we have a static method:
    - baseFunc(...)
    This is described in its own documentation, but it is static because it
    does not use any instance members.
    instance creation and usage:
    >>> from state import State
    >>> from bitMgr import BitMgr
    >>> b = BitMgr()
    >>> b.current()
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

    >>> b.next()
