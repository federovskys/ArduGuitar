# state.py
# 2016 05 30 added Vibrato and Tremolo, then removed it since all the dependencies need to be updated
# 2016 06 06 changed nbShiftRegs to 19 so as to integrate HMI LEDs; added pusbutton colors and 'PB' id
# 2016 06 10-30 : added new dits for integration of HMI
# 2016 09 04: update pin mappings after conflict issues
# 2016 09 13: updates for I2C LCD and new pin map for TracBall
# 2016 12 24:
#           : added pbBounceDelay
#           : changed splitPotCutOff to 60 instead of 30 to prevent ADC bounce!
# 2016 12 28: increased HWdeboucneDelay from 20 to 100 ms
#           :  pbDebounceDelay to pbProcessingDelay, this is used to reject
#              mutliple reactions to pb
