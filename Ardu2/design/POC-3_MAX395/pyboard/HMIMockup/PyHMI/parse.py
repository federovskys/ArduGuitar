parsing coil-node expressions

a coil Z has 2 endpoints: Z+ and Z-

a Node is of the form:
[LP, lM, ListOfPairs]
where 
* LP is a list of coil end points connected to OUT+
* LM is connected to OUT-
* ListOfPairs is of the form [[a,b],[x,y]..]
* where
** each pair is a pair of connections, eg. ['A+','B-']...

Let's say that the connections data structure is a list of lists:
[list-out+ list-out- list-of-lists-of-internal-connections]
[[out+] [out-] [[internal connection] [internal connection] ...]]

then we need to get the pair-wise connections of the form:
[[A+  out+] [a-  b+] [... etc]

thus we need some high level functions to define the circuit
and a function to get all the necessary connections

Define a Parallel connection
pp(coil1 &optional coil2 coil3 coil4)
paralllel connection of all the coils given

Define a Series connection
ss(coil1 coil2 &optional coil3 coil4)
series connection of all the coils given

both the above functions return a connection list which is the argument
needed to get the pair-wise list of connected terminals

Get the pair-wise connected terminals
connection-list (ss ('c1' 'c2' pp ('c3' 'c4')))
-> [["C1+" "out+"] ["C3-" "out-"] ["C4-" "out-"] ["C3+" "C4+"] ["C2-" "C3+"]
    ["C2-" "C4+"] ["C1-" "C2+"]]

all the others are helper functions
